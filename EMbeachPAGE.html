		<h1 id = "EMtitle" > Welcome to the Beach! </h1> 

		<p id = paragraph> Here at the beach, your kids can enjoy a playground with all sorts of fun equipment, a shallow end for those learning to swim, a deep end for those who are more adventurous, and a dock for sun tanning! You can also rent different types of boats to go out on the water. There is a cute boat that can take you around the lake as well called the Hardly Able. If you aren't the biggest fan of swimming, you can also enjoy the basketball court, the volleyball court, and the open field right across the street! </p>
